/**
 * WAI-ARIA Disclosure Pattern (Collapsible)
 *
 * Specification: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/
 *
 * A disclosure (collapsible) shows and hides a region of content via a button.
 * The button indicates the visibility state of the content region.
 *
 * ## Required ARIA
 * - Trigger: role="button" (native or explicit)
 * - Trigger: aria-expanded="true" | "false"
 * - Trigger: aria-controls={contentId}
 * - Content: id attribute for aria-controls reference
 *
 * ## Keyboard Support
 * - Enter: Toggles content visibility (on trigger)
 * - Space: Toggles content visibility (on trigger)
 *
 * ## Focus Management
 * - Trigger is focusable when not disabled
 * - Focus remains on trigger after activation
 * - Content is not focusable by default
 *
 * ## Disabled State
 * - Trigger cannot be activated when disabled
 * - Visual disabled styling (consumer responsibility)
 *
 * ## Presence
 * - Content unmounts when closed (default)
 * - Can force mount for animation/transition control
