/**
 * mergeProps
 *
 * Deterministic props merging.
 * - For non-handlers: `base` overwrites `injected`.
 * - For handlers present in both: handlers are composed with `injected` running
 *   first; it may call `preventDefault()` to suppress the `base` handler.
 *
 * POLICY DECISIONS (LOCKED):
 *
 * 1. Merge Strategy
 *    Base props overwrite injected props (base wins).
 *    Exception: Event handlers are composed, not overwritten.
 *
 * 2. Event Handler Detection
 *    Keys starting with "on" are treated as event handlers.
 *    This matches JSX conventions.
 *
 * 3. Handler Composition Order
 *    Injected handler runs first, base handler second.
 *    This allows injected handlers to prevent default.
 *
 * 4. Return Type
 *    Returns intersection type (TInjected & TBase) for type safety.
